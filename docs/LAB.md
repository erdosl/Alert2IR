# Lab Inventory

## Host

The physical hypervisor is Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS Desktop running VirtualBox 7.2.8. It has 64 GB RAM, 8 physical CPU cores, and ext4 SSD storage with substantial free capacity. It remains hypervisor-only; Codex is neither installed nor required there.

## Network

The VirtualBox host-only network is `192.168.56.0/24`. Each listed VM also has a VirtualBox NAT interface for normal Internet access.

Existing aliases follow `hostname`, `hostname.lab.test`, `hostname.admin`, and `hostname.admin.lab.test`. The `.admin` names currently resolve to the same host-only interfaces. They are aliases, not a separate management network.

WS03 successfully built, deployed, and validated the minimal containerized `core` service on `ir-core`. Validation covered the deterministic health endpoint, non-root runtime identity, loopback-only publication, restart convergence, and teardown/recreation. The service and its automatic Compose network were removed after validation; the built image and isolated validation artifact were intentionally preserved. Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and SSH were pre-existing host/bootstrap state and are not managed by the current Puppet catalog.

WS04 subsequently built and validated the typed Alert2IR core API on `ir-core` using the observed Docker Engine 29.7.2 and Docker Compose v5.4.0 runtime. Validation covered health, canonical investigate and no-action paths, strict request rejection, restart and full recreation, and publication only on `127.0.0.1:8000`. The validation service, container, and automatic Compose network were torn down afterward; the built image and isolated artifact may remain cached or preserved. This was not a permanent deployment, did not add PostgreSQL or external exposure, and did not place Docker under Puppet management.

## Existing telemetry path

Both Windows endpoints forward Sysmon Operational events to Splunk at `192.168.56.61:9997`. Current telemetry from both endpoints was verified during WS02 validation.

The current Universal Forwarder input is:

```ini
[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational]
disabled = 0
renderXml = true
index = main
source = XmlWinEventLog\:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
sourcetype = XmlWinEventLog
```

Effective forwarding is:

```ini
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

[tcpout:default-autolb-group]
server = 192.168.56.61:9997
```

Splunk currently uses the default `main` index. Installed apps include Splunk Add-on for Sysmon, Splunk Security Essentials, and Splunk Common Information Model. These are observed effective settings; the current Puppet catalog does not own the complete Splunk local configuration files, and this baseline does not redesign them.
